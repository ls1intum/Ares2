/**
 * Immutable security policy for supervised code execution.
 *
 * <p>Description: This record encapsulates all necessary details regarding supervised code, including its programming language
 * configuration, permitted resource accesses, and additional metadata. By using the immutable record pattern, it guarantees
 * thread-safety and reduces boilerplate. Input validation is performed in factory methods to ensure that every instance meets its invariants.
 *
 * <p>Design Rationale: Leveraging modern Java features such as records and nullability annotations enforces immutability and clarity.
 * The use of a factory method for construction and inâ€‘constructor validation ensures that only valid, consistent instances are created,
 * aligning with best practices for secure and maintainable design. The clear separation into nested records reflects the Single Responsibility Principle.
